# Image-Encryption-
Image is encrypted using shuffling, a combination of Tinkerbell and duffing chaotic maps and Cellular Automata.
i have broken down the whole encryption and decryption into a set of stages for better understanding and the output of each stage is inuput for the other
the order is as follows

INPUT IMAGE sent to Shuffling.py
Output of above sent to Encryption_of_Chaotic_maps.py
the file chaotic.py contains the code for chaotic key generation
The output image is input for Cellular_automat_encryption.py
the output is the final encrypted image
to decrypt 
pass the encrypted image through Decrypt_Cellular Automata.py
then its output img is passed through decryption_of_chaotic_map.py
the output image obtained is given in input to unshuffling.py
the decrypted image is obtained
